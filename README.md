Python bindings to [iceoryx2](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/) (from their README):

"""

Welcome to iceoryx2, the efficient, and ultra-low latency inter-process communication middleware. This library is designed to provide you with fast and reliable zero-copy and lock-free inter-process communication mechanisms.

So if you want to communicate efficiently between multiple processes or applications iceoryx2 is for you. With iceoryx2, you can:

- Send huge amounts of data using a publish/subscribe, request/response (planned), pipeline (planned) or blackboard pattern (planned), making it ideal for scenarios where large datasets need to be shared.
- Exchange signals through events, enabling quick and reliable signaling between processes.

iceoryx2 is based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and facilitates seamless inter-process communication (IPC).

## specifics

This is a work in progress and waiting on feedback from `iceoryx2` creators.
